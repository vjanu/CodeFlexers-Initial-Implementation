1)Replace the idcard.jpg and licence.jpg images in the tes-img folder with quality images
	*The existing images will not work as they were just taken from the internet to give only the idea
2)open cmd line
3)run python face_detect_nic_lisence.py
4)run lisence-sl-ocr using
	python lisence-sl-ocr.py

#)run lisence-sl-ocr-loop using
	python lisence-sl-ocr-loop.py
	This contains running of a loop untill the image is resized and identified the text

Remarks
----------
*This works perfectly with, 
	1)new license 

*face_detect_lisence.py can be used to insert images as command line arguements
