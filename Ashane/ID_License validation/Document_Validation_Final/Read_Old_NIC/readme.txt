1)Replace the idcard.jpg and images in the tes-img folder with quality images
	*The existing images will not work as they were just taken from the internet to give only the idea
2)open cmd line
3)run readOnlyNIC.py -> this will be hosted in localhost:80/nic/<image location>
	
Remarks
----------
*This works perfectly with, 
	old NIC
	will give the output in 12 digit format
