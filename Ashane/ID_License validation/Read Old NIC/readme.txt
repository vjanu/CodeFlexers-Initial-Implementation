1)Replace the idcard.jpg and images in the tes-img folder with quality images
	*The existing images will not work as they were just taken from the internet to give only the idea
2)open cmd line
3)edit face_detect_nic.py if necessary #can edit the src location only here,others change automatically
4)run readOnlyNIC using
	python readOnlyNIC.py
	*this will automatically run face_detect_nic.py 
	and after validating will run colorChange.py 
	and then run readOnlyNIC.py and give the result
	
Remarks
----------
*This works perfectly with, 
	old NIC
	will give the output in 12 digit format
