I'm so annoyed that I want to give my driver a bad rating, but that would to be fair.   has no idea of current traffic or road closure conditions so it took me an hour to get home when it should have been 15 minutes. It's not my driver's fault but I'm really annoyed will look to Lift next time.+2

I used  Pool over weekend as it is newly introduced in Melbourne claims to be 70% cheaper than usual version. It is quite a good product if you’re on a tight budget but drivers don’t seem keen on it, one time I used it I had to walk to pick up location about 15mins then wait a further 15mins for car to arrive, driver refuses to cross T junction of traffic lights to get to me (although he clearly knew it me as I only one at sidewalk waving at him).+3

I got charged a cancellation fee when I had thought I'd requested a driver at a certain time. It my first time using service, I selected time window then pickup drop off locations. But then I got a message telling me where 3 drivers were, not thinking anything of it went about getting ready until driver called. So needed to cancel. When I tried to book by destinations first choose car then booking window got an error message. So in end I booked it Just in time. There any story...+3
I booked one for transport to Melb airport. Tracker described car that on its way. Then info changed to another car supposedly because it closer - tho tracker said it further away. This meant pick-up time would be on far edge of requested pick-up time. A few minutes later tracker said that car had also canceled trying to find another driver. TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER DRIVER!?! YOU HAVE ONE JOB!! Fortunately, another car came only a few minutes late made great time I had allowed lots of extra time so it ended up ok (the driver I had great;.as previous one even tho he got lost due to traffic works) but it may not have. If you're pressed for time, use a taxi.+3
I have been   rider for past year i used it daily. I have noticed there prices has gone so high that there's not much difference in cab ride anymore. Its very disappointing how you guys keep doing that. also drivers not very aware of location which make us pay even more than we expected. I started using   because it fast affordable convenient but now its not same.One valued customer lost. Will not order   anymore.+3
Restricting to app booking, if data run low you in deep trouble. Gps coordination not easily accurate. Big problem if to explain address destination not approved by company or insurer. No easy way to rectify address. Email receipts incredible annoying with advertisement too many Image. Clogging email. Work cover now endorse   ride so with those Images on email receipts forced you to go to actual website to download invoice. Some drivers gets to cancel last minutes resulting late to appointment like to doctor visit.+3

If I could give a zero I would. We double charged for same journey a couple of weeks ago process for sorting out refund is absolutely shocking. I am in process of contacting trading standards local council registered with. I would not use   again if last taxi company on earth.,+1
Drivers fine... overcharge is not.....We experiencing high demand so we will be charging half as much again....cab turns up in 2 mins..... absolute rubbish.....I complained stock answer given then close ' case' so you can't reply to them. Very unhappy with customer service.,+1
I thought I should share this. I live in western mass area I a my local bar one day there a guy sitting next to me. His phone went off. he asked me if I ever used   before I told no. he continued to tell me that he is a   driver just got a job. He finished paying for jack coke then left. Be careful. u might be doing responsible thing by not drinking driving but what about your   driver.,+2
  scewed up whole NYC should be a small amount it’s not fair on yellow cabs working so hard these black cars come in take over screw up traffic park in Commercial parking which there not commercial vehicles cut you off in traffic worst drivers.,+2
I for one am not of having to walk to person picking me up. best service would be to pick up guest at confirmed pick up location. Me having to walk seems pointless when have car to drive to me. This is upsetting because last night I had 2 drivers cancel on me for not getting to my pick up spot on time. They only give you a 2 minute window spot is sometimes 5 or 6 minutes away. That is not fair because I get charged 5 dollars haven't even got in car. service must improve or   will no longer be my go to application for rides.,+2
We needed a ride in Prague to get us to train station. We hailed a ride then driver refused to take ride. Probably too short. I get it. second driver takes ride. then fails to show. I could see on map sitting in taxi line outside of a large hotel. I waited for 10 minutes. sent a message. asked several times if he coming. No response. I cancelled ride. so I dare them to charge me a cancellation fee. Fortunately. another driver took ride.,+2
extremely unreliable! 2 times in moring I had each moring about 4 cabs canceling on me! first of all. it shows you time how far cab is away.when you click on it. all odone a sudden it's quite a bit longer so I felt betrayed. specially in morning. when every minute counts jumping around to hearts content. & keep pn canceling!.,+2
Hiked prices means it’s such an expensive Service! Drivers often cancel last minute!.,+2
They drive longer distance in order to make more money. Even with GPS pretend that do not know where is address. Shame.,+2
I have been using   for about 2 years without any incidents. however when I travelled to Florida for vacation that's when trouble started I'm not sure how drivers there trained but on 2 occasions I charged twice extra after what my original price shown. after I dropped off to my destination I later got an email from   stating that I'm being charged extra due to navigational system issue with driver . now what I don't understand is why I am responsible for navigational issue . I'm paying what calculated at time of my pick up. I reached out to   with no help in n resolving matter my card has been charged .,+2
I've been using   for about 5 years now service has declined massively since beginning. quality of drivers is really poor on top of that don't pick you up from your location. instead charge you a waiting fee for time it takes to find your   driver. drivers often don't speak english when do. rude. system is broken I just hope another   comes out supercedes  .,+2
My latest ride with   a nightmare! I asked to extend my journey before I reached my first port of call but not warned that price would be MUCH higher....and also charged MUCH more because despite assurances to contrary he didn't know where he going it involved a longer journey. This experience has totally put me off using   I will not use them or reccomend service again!.,+2
The drivers horrible. sometimes dont show up.Sometimes have a nasty attitude. One driver never showed up then told me to cancel (which charged me). Another time I charged for two rides. when I only had one ride. Communication is horrible. is no one to contact for a complaint. only good thing I like about   is that you dont have to wait long.,+2
The bad but driver quite fast when reaching destination i requested. Everything else horrible.,+2
Unreliable - someone needs to create a more efficient service on this model!,+2
Some rides good. others terrible where you overcharged once I wasn't even dropped at location!,+2
They're cheap but drivers aren't very nice at all. One of them just sat in car watched me with two kids. one in a buggy shopping didn't bother to get out to help. today THREE of drivers cancelled on me. Think I'll go back to using Ad Lee. They're pricey but much better customer service.,+2
Was waiting 10 minutes outside for driver he's car wasn't getting any closer. Then all of a sudden he cancels   can't even give me a refund!?Rubbish.,+2
as someone that travels a lot with many services I am impressed but disappointed at same time. They have scaled so quickly forgot about minting quality control. Not impressed with my driver. He almost made me miss my time not familiar with city.,+2
Have seen sharp drop in service on   - car drivers driving out of way or not knowing how to get places.   customer service is not very helpful in remedying matter - will not acknowledge what is a bad situation. Pretty much a brush off. which offends me as a long time user.,+2
i had a bad experience of using it though most of my friends a fan of  .,+2
My issues had to do with using mobile app. while roaming and/or w/o WiFi connection all time... it gets very difficult to locate foreign drivers. navigate airports and/or conference centers. etc.,+2
It started off good. Ive had no problems up until recently. If i order my   to get me at a certain time it should not arrive 20 minutes early i set a time for a reason. Multiple times i have had to cancel   because driver coming earlier than scheduled. Also have had quite a few  s cancel on me past few weeks as on way i have to wait another 30 minutes minimum for another ride to pick me up. I use to really love   but app needs changing.,+3
Honestly sometimes   is great. But when I do   express sometimes it makes me walk place that have no sidewalks . no crosswalks . which is really not safe. Some drivers will come to you some won’t. I’ve had drivers cancel because I won’t cross where there’s not a cross walk on a busy street.,+3
So far usually reliable even at peak times. Worst experience when a driver took 20 minutes to arrive to relatively easy central location suddenly cancelled last minute despite our attempts to contact him. we had to pay for cancelled ride. Luckily   later refunded us fare.,+3
First. i keep getting cancelled by driver out of nowhere. Pls if cannot make it. DO NOT accept my request then! I waited for a driver for 5mins he have bloody nerve to cancel me?! One of day. i got cancelled thrice! Wow! Lottery isnt it?! Another one called ask me to find another driver. then why did u even accept it in first place?! Im not sure how   work. but if this is not driver issue. then company pls fix issue! U might have time to freaking fool around. but i dont.,+3
Second. whats with 10mins over waiting time. Okay 7-8mins onwards i can close my eyes say i WILL wait. But waiting 10mins for  ?! Might as well i mrt home i might be like halfway home issny it?! Some driver. idk what heck wrongs. like to waste time is it?? Pls fix these unneccessary issues!.,+3
More expensive than my local company. which surprising. Driver friendly. but will be using cheaper option next time.,+3
Used them on NYE whist late. apparently got lost. we did get home safely.,+3
I found that while   lacked incredible professionalism dedicated experience London cabs offered me. it still Ok most of times.,+3
Usually a pretty decent service. but if there is an issue do not count on getting customer service or a refund. You will not receive anything. Be at exact location BEFORE ride is scheduled to be there or can stop report you as a no show collect your money. We having a hard time finding pick up location exactly 2 minutes late our driver didn’t even try to call or text just canceled drive. but we charged anyway. When we reported it nothing done. Other rides we have used okay. Just be informed before using service. because you will not get your money back there no reproductions for poor drivers.,+3
  they’re obviously in a rush! What a waste of time money! driver didn’t even apologise when I voiced my concerns requested for suggestions on getting quicker! Although your services 75% of time have been ace that 25% needs work.,+3
Be very careful with peak fares when booking an   taxi. I urgently needed to get to a job interview couldn't use my car. Due to fact that I needed   to get me to there in morning on a weekday my fare ended up becoming really expensive.,+3
Excellent Services. always helpful.,+4
So far I can't complain.,+4
