Driver came to pick me up outside the front of my house only to cancel on me and drive off when I was walking out the front to get in the car, on top of this I was charged a $10 cancellation fee and uber won't give me my money back when I complained to them about the driver's poor behaviour.+1
The staff can take up to 12 hours to respond to simple questions and the answers are not always complete because they tend to give minimal information when it is obvious that closely related information could be of great use to the enquirer.+1
Totally dysfunctional & disappointing in relation to lost items, especially mobile phones! Inconvenient to communicate with them, no contact No, useless links, vicious circle guidance and in general unsupportive service. I prefer not to get service from them any more.+1
Ur drivers are extremely aggressive and impolite. They don't respect u. In the middle of the night, they are arguing with u over the address even tho u put the correct address. And when u are trying to direct the person to ur address, he hangs up after like arguing over 20 mins on phone. And u guys charged me for that.This is unacceptable. It will be really nice if u guys refund the money back.+1
Waited in a extremely accessible area for an uber that parked a very long way away, tried to communicate where i was waiting. Charged for the ride anyway even though he did not show up.+1
Twice the price of cabs, drivers don’t know the direction of trips, with passengers telling currently t routes and maps show extended routes, usually including tolls. Cars are small and not well kept.+1
I have never experienced worse customer service in my entire life. i have had an issue logging into my account for 3 weeks now and have sent numerous inquiries to get help. Customer service do not listen to your problem they tell you to look at their website and then they stop replying to you. I will never use the app again.+1
Biggest joke of my life! I have 5 mates with me and not one driver has said yes! They keep saying no and say it’s busy...Worst company of my life.+1
Had the driver text me just after I booked and he accepted to ask me where I was going, as soon as I responded he canceled my booking he obviously wanted a longer fare. Uber make it impossible to get in touch with them to discuss any complaints. I will never use Uber again.+1
Ashfield to potts points, and driver goes via north Sydney. After lodging a complaint with uber they reply and says price is fair, how could that be so when the trip would have taken half the time if driver had of taken propper route. your poor form will bite hard, money grabbers.+1
Driver and rude and aggressive towards me (a small female) who attempted to blame to for cancellation of the trip. The Driver cancelled the trip and the FW charged me cancellation fee. I am over the stress of their mistakes. I am returning to the cabs.+1
In cases where the driver cancelled without any apparent reason, why am I initially charged the cancellation fee? After pointing out this on the app, instead of refunding the fee back to the credit card, this is entered as a credit for future use.. isn't the customer given the final say? I would prefer the fee to be paid back into the credit card.+2
I was in love with Uber. I now have multiple experiences of cancellation. Uber drivers are displaying all the behaviours I disliked in cab drivers. I will walk and catch trams as much as I can. Never liked cabs. Was so rapt to have Uber around. Cabs now rank above Uber.+2
Over the last few days i have had any awful time with uber. First, the app put my location about 30 mins from where i was, then charged me a cancellation fee. I've now had 2 drivers in a row cancel their ride even though i could see the cars drive past me! There is also apparently no contact support section on the app. I would not recommend this if you have any other options.+2
Get it right Uber, don't bloody quote one thing then take loads more out. Where can I get in touch with Uber. If the driver this morning did the right thing, he would have known not to take the road he did. I don't believe I should pay for his mistake.+2
I’m going back to taxis. Arrival time is always later than estimated and actual fare is always well above estimated. This service promises a lot but fails to deliver. Don’t waste your time and money.+2
I have been a loyal customer of Uber for the past few years over cabs. But ive noticed surcharges increasing and far more frequent... over 3.0 most weekends its ridiculous! This is not an affordable service anymore. I feel like boycotting Uber now which is sad but feels like you're being greedy now. What happened to putting the users first, and offering an affordable service! This is absolutely rubbish Uber! Not happy :(!.+2
Trying to change your ph number in their system is simply crazy and impossible .... not sure why but it is ... they obviously dont need my business ...back to the normal cab company i guess ...+2
I feel to write this very bad reviews after 3 weeks of wrongs trips and dramas with the drivers about the route.The new GPS system is completely hopeless.Every time I must discuss with the driver.Everything wrong directions and follow one GPS that it looks like so far from the software that it must help you to find the destination.Result is that every trip become a terrible stressin drama.+2
My account has been disabled because I used it overseas with a different sim as I wasn't paying for roaming. Have sent uber numerous requests to enable my account even with photo evidence of license and cc but have had no response. Thought this app was awesome when I started but now it's a hassle!.+2
My Uber driver almost involved us in a head on collision yesterday. The driver did not understand the concept of giving way to the right at an intersection without an arrow. Even after I explained it, they were confused. The driver before that had a bad cold and was coughing everywhere. Never riding uber again.+2
I'm so annoyed that I want to give my driver a bad rating, but that would to be fair. Uber has no idea of current traffic or road closure conditions and so it took me an hour to get home when it should have been 15 minutes. It's not my driver's fault but I'm really annoyed and will look to Lift next time.+2
Excited at first but its not really good.There is very long wait especially if you are going to short trip and the racking shows cars near buy but they don't necessarily accept the job and who ever accepts comes to pickup after long wait.And the prices vary at times not reliable i have to say.+2
It was my first ride by Uber. I was on my way home from a interview, and a car ran up of the back of us, all is well now.+3
My Uber account was hacked and someone was able to some how have a shared account with me so I was paying for all their rides. I asked Uber how this was possible as they told me a guy called [name removed] was sharing my account. They never answered how this happened!!!.+3
I had a five star rating and remained at that rating after using uber for weeks , then all of a sudden I dropped to 4.97 There was no logical explanation I am always polite thank them for picking me up and thank and compliment when we reach the destination. I always give the driver 5 but now I think I am wasting my time being so nice.+3
I used UberPool over the weekend as it is newly introduced in Melbourne and claims to be 70% cheaper than the usual version. It is quite a good product if you’re on a tight budget but the drivers don’t seem keen on it, the one time I used it I had to walk to the pick up location about 15mins and then wait a further 15mins for the car to arrive, and the driver refuses to cross the T junction of traffic lights to get to me (although he clearly knew it was me as I was the only one at the sidewalk waving at him).+3
All Uber drivers are "TRACEABLE"....For your info, Uber should and can get hold any driver at any time (or they can lock them out if they have issues with them)!! To read some of the issues raised in this forum seems a little far-fetched or Uber is not being "Fair"... My opinion is to get these "dodgy" drivers identified and boot them out of Uber...gives us a bad name...+3
Redcliffe drivers gossip about every trip they do . I've heard from many passengers about every journey they have done.Unless it's a police matter and you don't take it to the police Ithey should shut up or not do the drive ? Best pay out of towners who are happy to cruise in and out . Next time could lead ya big mouths to a law suit.+3
I have not been in a cab for over two years because I could not praise Uber enough...well boy has that changed, cars are dirty, they have reduced the drivers commission I believe hence no more water and mints (loved this personal touch ), and now they charge up to triple the normal fare and why ? Because it’s a busy period ....so what let people wait a bit longer , it just means the drivers are making more money and being extra busy ! I’ll try the new Ola from now on !.+3
I got charged a cancellation fee when I had thought I'd requested a driver at a certain time. It was my first time using the service, I selected the time window then the pickup drop off locations. But then I got a message telling me where 3 drivers were, not thinking anything of it went about getting ready until the driver called. So needed to cancel. When I tried to book by destinations first choose the car and then the booking window got an error message. So in the end I booked it Just in time. There was any story...+3
I booked one for transport to Melb airport. Tracker described the car that was on its way. Then the info changed to another car supposedly because it was closer - tho the tracker said it was further away. This meant pick-up time would be on the far edge of requested pick-up time. A few minutes later the tracker said that car had also canceled and they were trying to find another driver. TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER DRIVER!?! YOU HAVE ONE JOB!! Fortunately, another car came and was only a few minutes late and made great time and I had allowed lots of extra time so it ended up ok (the driver I had was great;.as was previous one even tho he got lost due to traffic works) but it may not have. If you're pressed for time, use a taxi.+3
I have been uber rider for past year and i used it daily. I have noticed there prices has gone so high that there's not much difference in cab ride anymore. Its very disappointing how you guys keep doing that. And also drivers are not very aware of location which make us pay even more than we expected. I started using uber because it was fast affordable and convenient but now its not same.One valued customer lost. Will not order uber anymore.+3
Restricting to app booking, if data run low you are in deep trouble. Gps coordination are not easily accurate. Big problem if were to explain address destination not approved by company or insurer. No easy way to rectify the address. Email receipts are incredible annoying with advertisement and too many Image. Clogging email. Work cover now endorse uber ride so with those Images on email receipts forced you to go to the actual website to download invoice. Some drivers gets to cancel last minutes resulting late to appointment like to doctor visit.+3
I don't understand why this service has increasing its price "due to high demand" and now they apply "booking fee". It is suppose to be a fair price for a ride..maybe we should turn again to taxi services?.+3
I think it’s great for users not so good for the drivers , as i am the user also i drive with them and it pays terrible prices to its drivers.+4
Dont understand peoples issues .. With the cancellation fee even if that was done by the driver because you wernt at the meet up point you can get that back by a refund.Ive been using UBER to get around ..never have a problem with them .+3
no complaints from me.+4
Uber are generally excellent.+4
Definitely recommend UBER to anyone needing transport at any time and if you decide to use it make sure you're going to be travelling somewhere that's not in walking distance as there's a high minimum charge.+4
My Family and I have used Uber many times. Every now and then a driver tries to overcharge, such as going a longer route or overcharge on tolls. After contacting Uber, via the App, I have had all overcharges refunded within a couple of days. I can see that they are trying to keep their drivers in order, which would be an ongoing job. Overall, its still better than a taxi, so I suggest you just check you invoice each time.+4
Absolutely no issues with the driver who was very pleasant and efficient. My issue is with Uber pricing. Went to Help section on the App but it requires your issue to fit their formula, without offering any free comments area., usually an indication that this is a company that is not too concerned with customer satisfaction.+4
I love this service compared to the taxi rubbish we have here, but they need to iron out a few bumps before its perfect.+4
I was told your first time using Uber was free..great got to go to the airport I'll give them a go be nice to receive something free for a change. ..surprise surprise it cost me the same as my normal taxi does. ..how disappointing will be thinking twice now.+4
Uber is the only way I will travel when public transport is not available home from the city. It's fast, efficient and the cars and drivers are clean! I'm not surprised that the word is getting around how good they are and I certainly don't believe the bad reviews I've just read below!.+4
Great service, patchy service delivery.+4
it has an easy app to use that tells you wait times, fare estimates, trip breakdown.+4
excellent excellent.we were stuck with no one to help out trying to get home to the kids thank you uber we made it home within 30 mins price was a tad excy but didn't matter as long as we got home cheers.+5
Last time I ordered a cab they didn’t show up and left me on hold for an hour before I just hung up and caught an Uber. The Uber was at my home within 2 minutes. Uber’s are so much more reliable and cheap than taxis.+5
This is a great way to get around when on holiday! I was worried about it at first when I had to put in my card details but it is actually very safe. The drivers are lovely.+5
my uber experience was great, driver arrived on time, his vehicle was nice and clean and he took me to my destination without any problems.we had a few conversations and he was friendly.+5
Great service. Never had bad service.Uber are fantastic. I never use taxis anymore. They are much quicker and a lot cheaper. The cars are always clean and the drivers are very friendly. I feel safer in an uber as a female as opposed to a taxi.+5
I've never ever had any problems with Uber and find it to be a fast friendly reliable way to get from here to there. Most times if drivers go to the wrong address it's because you haven't moved the pin to the correct location. They don't know where to find you otherwise. I know it's an app based service and some people aren't savvy, but if you learn the way it works you shouldn't have more bad experiences.+5
Always quick. Very clean. So friendly. So much cheaper than a taxi and every car i have booked has been on time and efficient and the cars are up to standards .+5
Cheap and easy to use, the app on mobile devices makes it very easy to choose a pickup and drop off location, also like the payment through PayPal instead of cash.+5
This was better than any taxi ride. Downloaded ap night before we were going to need transport. When needed went to ap, booked . Told exactly how long to wait. Tracked it on ap. Car arrived. Dani our driver, polite, careful driver, took us straight to our destination in very clean new car. Couldn't fault. 5 star.+5
Uber is best for members of public.+5
ive been using uber for a while now and i am so impressed with their service also they so much cheaper than a taxi and half the time the driver lets you play your music in their own car which is a big bonus and the drivers are so nice and friendly and actually speak good english too.+5
I have just started driving for uber and am so blown away how easy the app is to use. So much information. Easy for the driver and rider. Drive whenever it suits. No boss to report to. Money quite reasonable for a no stress job compared to so many others I've had. Riders are ao nice. Well done to the inventor of this app and concept.+5
Sadly. support keeps lying in response. Odd names of the individuals in support suggest the lack of the local values.,+1
Anybody using Uber for any purpose does so at his or her own risk. Their apps are all toxic even dangerous. The driver app is weaponized and is capable of leading anybody they choose into ruin. It can somehow recognize all electronics so as to gain control from the cell tower. Never download it onto a phone you don’t plan to discard.,+1
Uber driver stolen my lapto computer uber dont do nothing about he still working in this company how is this posible a driver still working uber after stolen me a computer.,+1
Drivers of uber are v v rude.I don't know how they r appointed they don't even know the proper directions also they drive in wrong way...I now hate travelling in uber v bad experience I faced three times.V low rating I'm giving to uber bcoz of that.,+1
First ride on Uber - charged nearly double what I would normally pay for a taxi on the same route. Will not be using again and have deleted my account.,+1
Horrendous service. Advertised one price then charged me much more! When I asked why they added parking fees!.,+1
Uber is over. At this point most people realised it is a scam. It is never ontime. 2 minutes arrival estimate is just there to lure customers. You pay more that given estimate. Drivers have no idea where they are going. if the app freezes. you are on your own.,+1
There is no customer care contact for riders ..in case of loss item u can't contact anywhere.,+1
This was a terrible experience that was very inconvenient. I should not have to pay anything for such horrible service...otherwise I will discontinue use of this company all together and take the drivers recommendations of using Lyft instead... I will also be sharing this experience amongst my friends and family members as well as across my social media platform. This company will be receiving reviews from me based off this poor experience and the indilegence of not rectifying this issue completely.,+1
I’m using the uber most of the time when im going at work but recently the service and specially customer service on the phone getting poor and disappointing. I never have problem with adisson lee . To be honest. if you are in rush Do NOT use uber application because you’re wasting your Money as well as your TIME.,+1
I am never ceased to be amazed at how horribly difficult it is to find information on Uber's website and how difficult it is to get anything done when calling customer service. I no longer drive for the company because of the countless hours I have spent on ridiculous tasks. Today I've spent almost two hours trying to get my tax summary for last year. I've went through broken links. wrong links. 10 google searches and customer service who didn't know how to do what I needed. A supervisor finally put me on hold to check and I was disconnected. Seriously. Uber...get it together. It took me less than 3 minutes to get the exact same thing from Lyft.,+1
This is a really good company. they have made transportation easier. faster and safer. though quite expensive than the traditional ways of trans....tion. but it Worth's it!.,+1
I prefer a regular taxi. The drivers are very hit and miss. I've had a few good ones who have phone chargers and water. but also weird ones who tell awkward stories and don't keep the car clean. Overall. a taxi is a safer bet.,+1
If I could give a zero I would. We were double charged for the same journey a couple of weeks ago and the process for sorting out the refund is absolutely shocking. I am in the process of contacting trading standards and the local council they are registered with. I would not use Uber again if they were the last taxi company on earth.,+1
on two occasions have had driver cancel on me in sunderland at last minute . tbese guys will cancel you for a more expensive journey.,+1
Drivers are fine... The overcharge is not.....We are experiencing high demand so we will be charging half as much again....cab turns up in 2 mins..... absolute rubbish.....I complained stock answer given and then they close ' the case' so you can't reply to them. Very unhappy with customer service.,+1
I have no problem with any of the hundred drivers on each of my trips with Uber. Sadly. calling customer service is deeply frustrating for representative’s nauseatingly robotic responses to issues such as overcharging or routes taken - point blank refusing to look beyond what their occasionally-flawed system records. Add in a credit card hack on Uber’s side and finally after months of calls conceding that it was in fact their fault and you have the antithesis of customer service. Really very poor indeed.,+1
WHat an absolute waste of time. thought I would try Uber out to now be waiting 45 minutes from what initially said 12 minutes. then my driver disappers !!! Think I will stick with old fashioned taxis !! Will never use this rubbish service again cannot be trusted now really late.,+1
What a truly shocking experience. I've rarely used Uber and have always favoured Addison Lee or black cabs. However I thought I'd give it a go....I did the pool option and was asked to walk down dark quiet back streets to meet my driver. The driver drove off 3 times as apparently I took too long. The next driver I cancelled as the wait time was 5 mins.. and they fined me. Then they refused a refund.,+1
I thought I should share this. I live in the western mass area and I was a my local bar one day and there was a guy sitting next to me. His phone went off. he asked me if I ever used uber before I told him no. he continued to tell me that he is a uber driver and just got a job. He finished paying for his jack and coke then left. Be careful. u might be doing the responsible thing by not drinking and driving but what about your uber driver.,+2
Uber scewed up the whole NYC they should be a small amount it’s not fair on the yellow cabs working so hard and these black cars come in and take over they screw up traffic they park in Commercial parking which there not commercial vehicles they cut you off in traffic they are the worst drivers.,+2
I for one am not of having to walk to the person picking me up. The best service would be to pick up the guest at the confirmed pick up location. Me having to walk seems pointless when they have the car to drive to me. This is upsetting because last night I had 2 drivers cancel on me for not getting to my pick up spot on time. They only give you a 2 minute window and the spot is sometimes 5 or 6 minutes away. That is not fair because I get charged 5 dollars and haven't even got in the car. The service must improve or Uber will no longer be my go to application for rides.,+2
We needed a ride in Prague to get us to the train station. We hailed a ride and then the driver refused to take the ride. Probably too short. I get it. The second driver takes the ride. then fails to show. I could see on the map his was sitting in the taxi line outside of a large hotel. I waited for 10 minutes. sent him a message. asked him several times if he was coming. No response. I cancelled the ride. so I dare them to charge me a cancellation fee. Fortunately. another driver took the ride.,+2
extremely unreliable! 2 times in the moring I had each moring about 4 cabs canceling on me! first of all. it shows you the time how far the cab is away.when you click on it. all odone a sudden it's quite a bit longer so I felt betrayed. specially in the morning. when every minute counts they are jumping around to their hearts content. & keep pn canceling!.,+2
Hiked prices means it’s such an expensive Service! Drivers often cancel last minute!.,+2
They drive longer distance in order to make more money. Even with the GPS they pretend that they do not know where is the address. Shame.,+2
I have been using Uber for about 2 years without any incidents. however when I travelled to Florida for vacation that's when the trouble started I'm not sure how the drivers there are trained but on 2 occasions I was charged twice extra after what my original price shown. after I was dropped off to my destination I later got an email from uber stating that I'm being charged extra due to navigational system issue with the driver . now what I don't understand is why I am responsible for their navigational issue . I'm paying what was calculated at the time of my pick up. I reached out to uber with no help in n resolving the matter and my card has been charged .,+2
I've been using uber for about 5 years now and the service has declined massively since the beginning. The quality of drivers is really poor and on top of that they don't pick you up from your location. instead they charge you a waiting fee for the time it takes to find your uber driver. The drivers often don't speak english and when they do. they are rude. The system is broken and I just hope another uber comes out and supercedes Uber.,+2
My latest ride with Uber was a nightmare! I asked to extend my journey before I reached my first port of call but was not warned that the price would be MUCH higher....and was also charged MUCH more because despite assurances to the contrary he didn't know where he was going and it involved a longer journey. This experience has totally put me off using Uber and I will not use them or reccomend their service again!.,+2
The drivers are horrible. sometimes they dont show up.Sometimes they have a nasty attitude. One driver never showed up and then told me to cancel (which charged me). Another time I was charged for two rides. when I only had one ride. Communication is horrible. their is no one to contact for a complaint. The only good thing I like about Uber is that you dont have to wait long.,+2
The bad but the driver was quite fast when reaching the destination i requested. Everything else was horrible.,+2
Unreliable - someone needs to create a more efficient service on this model!,+2
Some rides are good. others are terrible where you are overcharged and once I wasn't even dropped at the location!,+2
They're cheap but the drivers aren't very nice at all. One of them just sat in the car and watched me with two kids. one in a buggy and shopping and didn't bother to get out to help. And today THREE of their drivers cancelled on me. Think I'll go back to using Ad Lee. They're pricey but much better customer service.,+2
Was waiting 10 minutes outside for the driver and he's car wasn't getting any closer. Then all of a sudden he cancels and uber can't even give me a refund!?Rubbish.,+2
as someone that travels a lot with many services I am impressed but disappointed at the same time. They have scaled so quickly and forgot about minting quality control. Not impressed with my driver. He almost made me miss my time and was not familiar with the city.,+2
Have seen sharp drop in service on uber - car drivers driving out of way or not knowing how to get places. Uber customer service is not very helpful in remedying the matter - and will not acknowledge what is a bad situation. Pretty much a brush off. which offends me as a long time user.,+2
i had a bad experience of using it though most of my friends a fan of uber.,+2
My issues had to do with using the mobile app. while roaming and/or w/o WiFi connection all the time... it gets very difficult to locate foreign drivers. navigate airports and/or conference centers. etc.,+2
It started off good. Ive had no problems up until recently. If i order my uber to get me at a certain time it should not arrive 20 minutes early i set a time for a reason. Multiple times i have had to cancel the uber because the driver was coming earlier than scheduled. Also have had quite a few ubers cancel on me the past few weeks as they are on their way and i have to wait another 30 minutes minimum for another ride to pick me up. I use to really love uber but the app needs changing.,+3
Honestly sometimes uber is great. But when I do uber express sometimes it makes me walk place that have no sidewalks . no crosswalks . which is really not safe. Some drivers will come to you and some won’t. I’ve had drivers cancel because I won’t cross where there’s not a cross walk on a busy street.,+3
Normally good service apart from when drivers accept your request.They need to know if they will be anle to take on the journey or no. I got 3 drivers cancelling on me after they have accepted the call. That is absolutely unacceptable. I missed my train and got late for meeting.,+3
Uber is a very convenient service. However. I’m fed up getting charged £5 when the driver can’t locate my location. even when we have spoken on the phone.,+3
Uber is never the same ride twice. even if I'm going door to door with the same addresses. The ride fare changes by time of day. and if I don't like what they quote it's a little less 10 minutes later.,+3
I like travelling with Uber but sometimes pricing is very high.Sometimes they offer discount coupons but often the prices are too high.,+3
So far usually reliable even at peak times. Worst experience when a driver took 20 minutes to arrive to relatively easy central location and suddenly cancelled last minute despite our attempts to contact him. And we had to pay for his cancelled ride. Luckily Uber later refunded us the fare.,+3
First. i keep getting cancelled by driver out of nowhere. Pls if they cannot make it. DO NOT accept my request then! I waited for a driver for 5mins and he have the bloody nerve to cancel me?! One of the day. i got cancelled thrice! Wow! Lottery isnt it?! Another one called and ask me to find another driver. then why did u even accept it in the first place?! Im not sure how Uber work. but if this is not the driver issue. then company pls fix the issue! U might have the time to freaking fool around. but i dont.,+3
Second. whats with the 10mins over waiting time. Okay 7-8mins onwards i can close my eyes and say i WILL wait. But waiting 10mins for uber?! Might as well i mrt home and i might be like halfway home issny it?! Some driver. idk what the heck wrongs. like to waste time is it?? Pls fix these unneccessary issues!.,+3
More expensive than my local company. which was surprising. Driver was friendly. but will be using the cheaper option next time.,+3
Only bad thing is when the charge you double because their busy.,+3
Used them on NYE and whist they were late. apparently got lost. we did get home safely.,+3
Had some really friendly and helpful drivers out there apart from this and it annoyed me but not enough to leave a bad review at the time.,+3
I found that while Uber lacked the incredible professionalism and dedicated experience London cabs offered me. it still was Ok most of the times.,+3
Usually a pretty decent service. but if there is an issue do not count on getting customer service or a refund. You will not receive anything. Be at the exact location BEFORE the ride is scheduled to be there or they can stop report you as a no show and collect your money. We were having a hard time finding the pick up location and were exactly 2 minutes late and our driver didn’t even try to call or text just canceled the drive. but we were charged anyway. When we reported it nothing was done. Other rides we have used were okay. Just be informed before using the service. because you will not get your money back and there are no reproductions for poor drivers.,+3
Uber they’re obviously in a rush! What a waste of time and money! The driver didn’t even apologise when I voiced my concerns and requested for suggestions on getting their quicker! Although your services 75% of the time have been ace that 25% needs work.,+3
They never respond to the queries raised in-app.,+3
The drivers I have had have been excellent. Clean cars and professional. Many working Uber as a second job. Uber wrote an app and you download it. They receive a good amount of the money earned. They must be selling millions of rides. If the company is losing money and charging people for rides they didn't order there is a name for those kind of people.,+3
Be very careful with peak fares when booking an Uber taxi. I urgently needed to get to a job interview and couldn't use my car. Due to the fact that I needed Uber to get me to there in the morning on a weekday my fare ended up becoming really expensive.,+3
Not too bad. I know Uber gets a bad rap but i find it great across the world to get into fully trackable cars and be driven around the country. Thansk for making me feel safe.,+3
Seems simple but very useful when its cold with children thanks,+4
Excellent Services. always helpful.,+4
So far the experience of booking has been very smooth. queries answered promptly as I told my friends who have asked me to contact you about another booking,+4
Finding a good taxi firm at a decent price in another country with these guys was as easy as hailing one and if all goes well with the transfer they will surely get the other star!,+4
Easy to arrange the taxi was there to meet us even though our flight was very early clean car very friendly driver,+4
Easy booking. quick feedback. not big choice. which for me is also positive as I did not have to spend much time on comparing price-quality of different offers,+4
Uber is a great service. regardless of the mostly negative reviews. It’s cheaper than owning and managing a car. using public transit services. and most of the drivers are friendly and great drivers. We all want to complain about that one time a service was horrible. but it doesn’t represent the two hundred other times that the service was above average. or excellent.,+4
So far UBER is the best taxi service (as for me).UBER support always handles all my claims in the best and fastest way. They do care about clients even though sometimes cars and drivers are NOT the best.,+4
As a regular user could say that service is well. much easier to get then regular cab.,+4
Im a regular user. The only thing is that the offers I used to get are not available right now. Would be happy to get more offers as a regular commuter.,+4
Great cars. great drivers. great manners. Nothing more needs to be said.,+4
Uber provides a really good service. with competitive prices. Their cars are kept in top shape. and the drivers are always nice and friendly. Definitively a top contender.,+4
Sometimes they can be a bit too talkative. when it's not necessary. but people are different and it's sort of a social situation. so.. plus their rating is at stake. It's understandable!.,+4
Good business. The app has greatly improved since a year or two ago.,+4
My overall experience with Uber has been positive. It's a lot better than getting a taxi. and the drivers are always really nice and up for a chat. Some elements of the app. such as the interactive map. are good too.However. a lot of times the app is difficult to use. The GPS isn't great and sometimes says I'm in the wrong location or won't tell the driver what side of the street I'm on. resulting in delays/confusion particularly on busy nights. I've also never been able to successfully split the fees. it always displays an error message. and once I even accidentally cancelled a ride when I was trying to cancel the fee share as it wasn't working. Please work on this!!.,+4
Uber is a great concept and most of the time Uber provides excellent service with economical fares compared to mini cabs and black cabs. Never experienced any safety issues having used Uber for more than 3 years now. However there are some down sides to Uber. Peak demand surcharge is questionable when there are plenty of taxis available. Does not make sense to charge customers twice in the name of peak demand surcharge. Also waiting charge is abused by drivers when you do not even make them wait. this charge is still added to receipt by the drivers.,+4
Nice service. helpful driver. decent vehicle.,+4
Love uber. But sometimes the drivers are so rude when it's their fault they got lost and then cancel rides and end up having to wait for another one. Or they accept when they don't even come. One driver accepted but didn't move for half and hour. He was probably still in bed asleep! I cancelled the ride and got charged. Got a refund tho..,+4
So far I can't complain.,+4
My experience with Uber was pretty good! it was last month and i still remember! how desperately i had to reach the place for an important interview. The driver was so talented knew how to drive fast but controlled and so good with google maps and navigation!.,+4
We highly recommend his transportation services. It is prompt. knowledgeable .accommodating and overall a delight to be around. Thank you for all your assistance. You made our trip perfect.,+5
great service will definitely use again,+5
Yoh what a great experience we had from or tambo airport with you guys. Our driver Walter you are the man of the match. Yes you did it so patiently calm and you driving like a pro. Really keep up the good work. most definitely i will recommend you guys to anyone. Thanks alot you make our stay so much easily,+5
This site is really good. Professional quick replies at very competitive prices. Will certainly use again. Hope the taxi service is as good as the website experience.,+5
The company provides quick response to your transaction needs including the type of vehicle requested at a reasonable price.,+5
Excellent quick service which found us a great taxi ride in a high quality car at a very reasonable price. A very good find!,+5
Thank you! Easy to use. helped me find good price and car. Will recommend to my friends.,+5
Great service. Everything was perfect. Best price finder and very fast information. For sure will use again and recommend everyone.,+5
Great service . very convenient . Just what was required to be honest .,+5
As a first time use of this site it was very helpful and very easy to use. the quote that I have used was the best price and the team where quick to respond. Will use again and pass on my experience's to other travellers.,+5
Excellent - I have been using their services regularly. Except for 1 or 2 bad experiences(for which Uber refunded the fees). things have not been bad.,+5
Revoloutionary.,+5
My driver was very polite and conversed nicely she was very accommodated with being an appropriate driver no worries the whole ride got me through my route efficiently. safely. and timely I would recommend her at top rate accommodation and service I was very pleased with my experience she was an outstanding ride from and to my location. massiel performs professionally and the ride was very comfortable and a 5 star rating was necessary. Recommend her to any Uber rider in the area.,+5
My Uber driver got me to my destination in time! great service! !.,+5
Honestly. you gotta be a quite a douche to get on the wrong side of the drivers. It's an epic app. service. cheaper than taxis. and perfect for the modern world.,+5
Great. convienent. easy to use. and no pressure for tip.,+5
They are just great. I've ridden many times with Uber and did not even have a single problem. I like how they changed the transportation in my city!.,+5
great service. easy app to use . when ever we had a problem with a service. their customer service team sorted it and refunded us accordingly.,+5
Very fine service very clean cars and very polite drivers.,+5
I love it. Previously I needed to deal with damn taxi operators. who expected me to know the exact format they used to communicate my departure and arrival time within 0.0024123 nanoseconds. now I can just use my phone. Also the drivers are nices since I can mess with their rating if they arent.,+5
